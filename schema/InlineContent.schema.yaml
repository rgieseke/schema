description: Union type for valid inline content.

  Note that this definition currently does not include
  `array` and `object` nodes (which are included in `Node`).
  This seems incongruent, and may be changed in the future.
  The order of these types is important because it determines the
  order of attempted coercion (particularly important for primitive types).
anyOf:
  # Primitive nodes
  - type: 'null'
  - type: boolean
  - type: integer
  - type: number
  - type: string
  # Entities
